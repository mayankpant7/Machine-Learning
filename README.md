# Machine-Learning

## Data Preprocessing :
It is the most critical step in the journey of machine learning . 
If there is no data preprocessing then your machine learning model will not be that much be efficient so if you want efficient ml model , your first step should be data preprocessing.
As per real time industry there is exact 7 steps in data preprocessing :
1 Get the dataset
2. Importing the library
3. inporting the dataset
4. mixing dataset
5. categorical data 
6. splitting the dataset into thraining and test set
7. Feature scaling

## 1.Get the dataset : 
At first we need dataset to implement any kind of ml model
Based on dataset our machine will learn to perform task .
In industry client will provide us the dataset

## 2. Importing the library : 
To build machine learning model we need to perform several steps and libraries will help us to do those steps in easiest manner 

## 3. Importing the dataset : 
For importing the dataset we will use read_csv function . 
read_csv () is present in pandas library .

## 4. Missing data :
Whenever you are going to work on real time dataset then missing data problem is very common in dataset so if we want to build efficient ml model then first we need to deal with missing data problem .
First way by which we can overcome missing data problem is to remove the record from dataset which contain missing data but this is not a feasible solution in industry because industry data is very critical in most of the cases.
